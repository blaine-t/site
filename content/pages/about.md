Hello! My name is Blaine Traudt and I am a sophomore in the Raikes school at UNL.

I have interests in GNU/Linux, cybersecurity, networking, optimization, and financial independence. My current machine is running Arch Linux which I installed using my own custom install script [archBT](/projects/archbt/). I am planning on getting a Computer Science degree with two [focus areas](https://computing.unl.edu/focus-areas/), cybersecurity and networking. I run my home network off of an [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/) instance on my server running [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) to have more control over my home network. I spend way too much time worrying about optimization, which can be seen in [this blog post](/blog/siteperformance/), and financial independence, which can be seen in [this blog post](/blog/youngfinanceadvice/). I also plan on getting a minor in business with my experience from my Raikes classes and [working with Speedway Motors in eCommerce](/blog/speedwaymotors/).

I am currently looking for an internship for the upcoming 2025 summer. Please reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blaine-traudt/) or [Email](mailto:blaine@traudt.dev) if you think I would make a good fit for your team!
