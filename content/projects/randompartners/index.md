This project provides a solution to the problem of generating random lab partner assignments that are different for each iteration. Instead of randomly generating an assignment for each day (which would inevitably cause repeated partnerships), we ([Anton Angeletti](https://github.com/anton-3) and I) implement an algorithm that creates the maximum possible number of partnerships without repeats
