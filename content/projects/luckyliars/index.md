Lucky Liars is AI-powered murder mystery game that generates a new experience every playthrough

Playing as Detective Derek Dynamo of the FBI, you are investigating a murder case. The twist: the murder case is different every time you play the game! You must interview the same 3 suspects every time, and the true killer is always among them, though it will be a different suspect in different playthroughs. You are armed with a powerful tool: the Probability Polygraph, which rolls a die from 1 to 20 each time it observes a potential lie. The closer you are to 20, the more likely it is that spikes on the polygraph represent an actual lie.
