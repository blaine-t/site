AKA FOG for short

This project is a hobby project of mine to use the Microsoft Graph API to forward emails from an Outlook account to any number of other email accounts automatically when you receive an email

Forward emails automatically with extra features like:

- Catch-all email addresses
- Add or don't to Sent box
- Multiple forwarding addresses

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/blaine-t/fwd_outlook_graph/blob/main/docs/usage.md)_

Source code and more information [available on Github](https://github.com/blaine-t/fwd_outlook_graph)!
