CornCycle is a unique, real-life recreation of the iconic Tron Lightcycle game, brought to life for CornHacks 2025. 

CornCycle transforms a traditional digital game into a physical experience by combining computer vision, embedded systems, and interactive projection. Players control custom-built RC cars with game console remotes while avoiding digital light trails projected onto the table surface.

I worked on constructing and programming the hardware and mounting the projector!
